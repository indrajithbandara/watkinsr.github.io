His knowledge and passion for making great products is what has lead him to make a 2D RPG Engine in SDL, create an android breakout game, build a complete system for a public sector company to protect top secret documents and also to enhance the user experience of a well known FinTech product. His latest project is a Quantum Programming Language that interfaces with a self-made python quantum simulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course naturally you can find the projects on Github as Ryan is a big supporter of the Open Source Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only this, but his desire to learn more is what produces his great results. As a computer scientist and even more so as a web developer, you have to be constantly reading and learning about new trends and new technologies, his Kindle is stacked with many computer science books to keep him firmly in the web development scene.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category></entry></feed>
