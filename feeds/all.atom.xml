Framework to allow developers to make their own 2D RPG's in C++. 100% grade awarded in first semester. Over 3000 lines of code. Technologies used were SDL and C++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum Programming Language
Third semester project, full simulator and language that runs Deutsch's algorithm and C-like code. Research paper to come soon (April 2016). Technologies used: Python, C, YACC and LEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easyquantum - Quantum Computing Lessons
Project to teach computer scientists about quantum computing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakout - Android Game
Android breakout game done in second year at University of Reading. Contains a few advanced features (you can control two paddles and there are multiple balls)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Who am I?</title><link href="http://watkinsr.github.io/about.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-01-07T14:47:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Watkins</name></author><id>tag:watkinsr.github.io,2016-01-07:about.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ryan is the founder and CTO of startup 'feistybird', which has captured signups from big brands such as Microsoft. His knowledge and passion for making great products is what has lead him to make a 2D RPG Engine in SDL, create an android breakout game, build a complete system for a public sector company to protect top secret documents and also to enhance the user experience of a well known FinTech product. His latest project is a Quantum Programming Language that interfaces with a self-made python quantum simulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course naturally you can find the projects on Github as Ryan is a big supporter of the Open Source Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only this, but his desire to learn more is what produces his great results. As a computer scientist and even more so as a web developer, you have to be constantly reading and learning about new trends and new technologies, his Kindle is stacked with many computer science books to keep him firmly in the web development scene.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category></entry></feed>
